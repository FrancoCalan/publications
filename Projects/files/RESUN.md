## Introduction

![Interaction Details](RESUN_Interaction_Sketch.png
"Interaction Details") Project RESUN (*Radio EVLA Search for UHE
Neutrinos*) is an experiment that measures the isotropic Ultra High
Energy (UHE: E \> 10<sup>19</sup> eV) neutrino flux via observations of
neutrino-lunar baryon interactions. Potential UHE neutrino sources
include Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) primaries, GZK-induced showers from
UHE cosmic rays, Z-bursts from massive primordial remnant particles, and
topological defects. For distant ( \> 50 Mpc, 1 Mpc = 3 x
10<sup>22</sup> m) sources, neutrinos are the only way to probe physical
processes at UHE energies, due to the strong interaction of cosmic ray
primaries with Cosmic Microwave Background photons.

## Equipment Setup

The experiment utilizes multiple 4 antenna sub-arrays of Expanded Very
Large Array (EVLA) antennas to monitor the lunar limb for
nanosecond-duration Cerenkov radio bursts in a 50MHz band centered at
1.4 GHz. Antenna receiver voltage levels are sampled, thresholded,
timestamped, compared to other sub-array antennas, and stored using two,
2-channel [ADC2x1000-8](ADC2x1000-8 "wikilink") units attached to one
[IBOB](IBOB "wikilink") device. The ADC's are clocked at 400MHz (10ns
per channel), slightly oversampling the bandwidth to include receiver
power past the 3dB roll-off point.

## Deployment

**Phase-A:**

![Phase-A Collection](RESUN_collection_Feb2008.jpg "Phase-A Collection")
45 hrs, completed in March 2008, utilized one sub-array of 4 EVLA
antennas with 50MHz bandwidth (RCP). Each antenna is offset from lunar
center to specifically target the lunar limb (\~ 33% limb coverage).
This phase had two goals:

1.  provide proof-of-concept demonstration of the hardware and software
    schemes needed for Phase-B

<!-- end list -->

1.  verify the lower limit to isotropic UHE neutrino flux determined
    from previous experiments.

Although no detections were made, we verified the most sensitive
previously published lower flux limit for isotropic neutrinos in the
energy range 10<sup>20.5-21.5</sup> eV. (results in press)

**Phase-B:**

200 hrs, starting Sept. 2009, will utilize four 4-antenna sub-arrays
with 100MHz bandwidth (sampling both RCP and LCP polarization channels).
The antennas in each sub-array are offset to different locations on the
lunar limb, providing 100% coverage and beam overlap for finer pulse
location resolution. The combination of full limb coverage, dual
polarization, and 5x more observing time will probe neutrino fluxes more
than one order of magnitude lower than has ever been observed.
