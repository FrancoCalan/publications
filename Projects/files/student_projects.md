## Projects with CASPER ##
Characterize the tail end of the power-law distribution of crab giant pulses using the Leuschner radio dish.

Construct a web engine to parameterize spectrometer design using the casper tool flow:
number of channels, bandwidth, resolution, accumulation time, readout options, etc...

Software reorder - create a casper block that generates a reorder sequence for our streaming fft block at compile time so that channel reordering can be done in software rather than hardware.

Zoom-mode spectrometer - create a two-fft spectrometer that will selectively zoom in on a single spectral channel (using the xilinx enable-able fft block)
