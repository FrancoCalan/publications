# The MOFF Correlator

The MOFF (Modular Optimal Frequency Fourier) correlator is a variation
of direct imaging correlators that is particularly well suited for HI
epoch of reionization and dark energy measurements. It's advantages are:

:\* The output is fully calibrated: the image produced is an optimal
map. (Particularly important for polarimetry.)

:\* There are no constraints on the antenna layout or type: a randomized
distribution can be used as can larger multi-wavelength antennas or even
heterogeneous arrays.

:\* Direction dependent gain, heterogeneous antenna responses,
w-projection, and refractive and scintillating ionospheric distortions
can all be easily incorporated.

:\* It is equally or more efficient than a regular grid FFT correlator,
and for very compact radio cosmology arrays can be orders-of-magnitude
more efficient than an FX correlator.

:\* As it forms a calibrated electric field image as an intermediate
product, could be very interesting for pulsar searches.
